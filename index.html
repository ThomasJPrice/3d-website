      <h2>üìú Manifesto</h2>
      <p>
        As a 16-year-old, I'm passionate about technology and creativity. I believe in the power of combining technical skills with imaginative ideas to create meaningful and innovative solutions. Throughout my journey, I've been dedicated to mastering web development and design, which has allowed me to express my creativity while providing practical solutions for businesses. My ambition is to continue growing these skills and using them to make a positive impact in the digital world.

      <p>
        Starting my own business at a young age has taught me invaluable lessons in entrepreneurship, responsibility, and perseverance. Whether it's developing a unique recipe for my confectionary business or designing a client's website from scratch, I approach each project with a commitment to excellence and a drive to exceed expectations. I believe that with dedication and hard work, young people can achieve extraordinary things and contribute significantly to their communities and industries.

      <p>
        In the future, I aspire to further develop my technical and creative abilities, aiming to become a leading figure in the tech and design industries. I am committed to continuous learning and innovation, always seeking new challenges and opportunities to grow. My ultimate goal is to inspire other young people to pursue their passions and demonstrate that age is no barrier to achieving remarkable success.

      <h2>üë©üèΩ‚ÄçüöÄ Projects</h2>

      <p>
        One of my notable projects is the creation and development of my own online confectionary business, Fujj. I started Fujj in May 2020, where I was involved in every aspect of the business, from developing a unique recipe to designing the branding and packaging. I built the entire ecommerce website using modern programming languages, ensuring a smooth and attractive user experience. Additionally, I actively marketed the products through social media and participated in events to sell directly to the public. This project not only honed my technical and design skills but also taught me essential business management and customer service skills.
      </p>

      <h2>üèÜ Accomplishments</h2>

      <p>
        Among my proudest accomplishments is achieving a 5-star hygiene rating for my confectionary business, Fujj. This required rigorous adherence to local food safety regulations and demonstrated my commitment to quality and excellence. Additionally, I have earned a Level 2 Distinction* in Creative iMedia and completed the Duke of Edinburgh Award at the Silver level, with the Bronze level achieved the previous year. These accomplishments reflect my dedication to both academic and personal development, showcasing my ability to balance multiple responsibilities and excel in diverse areas.
